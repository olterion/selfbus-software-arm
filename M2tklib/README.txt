u8glib library 1.17 for ARM. Copied on Jan 2014 from https://code.google.com/p/u8glib/
See there for license and restrictions.

May have here slight adaptions for the ARM PRO MINI but in general trying
to keep this as stock as possible. The repository here provides it as an
easy to install LPCXpresso project that works with ARM PRO MINI out of the
box.
